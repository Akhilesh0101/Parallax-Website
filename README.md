# Parallax-Website
This is a parallax website using HTML and CSS
Parallax scrolling is a web design technique in which the website background moves at a slower pace than the foreground. This results in a 3D effect as visitors scroll down the site, adding a sense of depth and creating a more immersive browsing experience. Parallax is based on optical illusion
